    alt: "collage artwork with firey oranges and reds cut into long thin strips, drawn toward a center point and rising like a cathedral spire. Snippets of text in the collage include \"punch a clock\", \"there!\", \"I sit in a chair full of holes\". Many of the images evoke 1970s science fiction comics."

{% include gallery caption="Mirror worlds: Explorations of near-symmetry" %}

Discussions of symmetry and patterns in mathematics are often illustrated by reference to the natural world. The presence of randomness and chaos in nature means that there is always a departure from symmetry--in fact, we notice and feel uncomfortable when symmetry is perfect. Have you ever looked at a picture of your own face, reflected digitally? Or noticed immediately when the background of a movie is poorly rendered CGI? In this series, I develop geometric patterns built on reflective symmetry, and overlay these with images and shapes cut from advertisements, comics, and old magazines. In many of the images, I've cut reflected shapes from two parts of the same image, so that the colors are never exactly replicated.
