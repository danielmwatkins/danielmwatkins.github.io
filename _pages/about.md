Hi there! My name is Daniel Watkins. I’m a climate scientist specializing in Arctic sea ice and atmosphere. I received my doctorate from Oregon State University in spring 2022, and currently work as a postdoctoral research associate in the Wilhelmus Lab at Brown University.

My research focuses on the Arctic climate. I’m especially interested in the atmospheric boundary layer, which is the part of the atmosphere that responds directly to changes in the surface. The Arctic atmospheric boundary layer is especially interesting (and complicated) because there are big changes through the year–from snow to vegetation, from sea ice to open water, from polar night to midnight sun. I participated in the MOSAiC expedition (which I wrote about here). My work with MOSAiC uses drifting buoys to observe sea ice motion and deformation.

In addition to my research work, I’m a Science Communication Fellow at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, and a science writer for Science Journal for Kids. From 2018-2021, I was a host on the science radio show and podcast Inspiration Dissemination.

I'd love to hear from you. You can reach me at daniel underscore watkins at brown dot edu, or though direct message on Twitter or Instagram.
