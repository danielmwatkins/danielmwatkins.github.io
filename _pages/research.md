The Arctic is a critical component of the Earth's climate system. Atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean are tightly coupled. Sea ice loss over the last decades is one of the strongest signals of the Earth's response to rising greenhouse gases. My research seeks to understand the role of sea ice in the context of a changing climate system.
